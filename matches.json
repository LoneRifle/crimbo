Husband used to be the sole income earner, with client taking charge of the household chores and caregiving of children. However, he suffered a stroke towards the end of last year and had to stop work. Client has since started her own home baking business, whilst managing the multiple caregiving responsibilities at home, which includes both caring for children and husband. Client's oven broke down recently and she hopes to acquire a new oven to help keep her business running to supplement the household income. Oven will go straight to client to help her generate income to meet the basic needs at home.",
