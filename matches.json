Besides my client (who is a single mother) and her 2 young daughters, her 80 years old frail and elderly grandmother is also staying with her. The damaged and “anytime can collapse” wardrobe poses a danger to her 2 very young children and her frail and elderly grandmother. In view of the above, she needs the kind assistance of kind PassITOn donors / sponsors so that she can secure a new wardrobe within a short period of time.
