In spite of such hostile environment, senior has consistently stated his preference to continue to stay at home and declined for nursing home placement.

He is diagnosed with mental health conditions and is certified temporarily unfit for work. He does not have familial support and is hoping to receive some support to help him tide through his financial constraints. Client's shoe size is US46. For the slipper, he hopes to receive an open-toes slipper so that there would not be friction between his toes which has caused him discomfort and injury in the past. Thank you!",
