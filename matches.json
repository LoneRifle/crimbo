    "description": "Client (F/70), a retiree, were one of the Henderson residents who were under HDBâ€™s relocation exercise. However, client has yet to begin packing her belongings for the move due to experiencing anxiety over having to pack her items on her own. Additionally, HDB had provided a dateline of Sept 2025, which further intensified client's anxiety. To increase her anxiety, client does not appear to have any form of familial support to seek support from. \nClient currently lives alone in a 2-room rental flat and is experiencing significant cluttering issues, causing furnitures to wear out due to longevity of use. The cluttering of items also stress client out as she was alone and was unable to do it alone. Therefore, with the help of these new items, it would alleviate client's anxiety and help smoothen her journey to this very upsetting relocation exercise.
