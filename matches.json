    "description": "Yishun Family Service @ Children’s Society is seeking a 2 doors fridge, no other preferences for a family in need. The family will be moving into their new rental flat soon, but due to limited financial means, they are struggling to furnish their home. Their daughter has just begun her Junior College education, which has placed additional strain on their budget as they work to provide her with essential school items such as uniforms and a scientific calculator. We hope to ease the family’s financial burden by supporting them with basic home furnishings. Delivery will need to be arranged directly by the kind donor. If you wish to contribute, please click “Donate” and our team will get in touch with you shortly. We sincerely thank you for your kindness and generosity in supporting this family.",
