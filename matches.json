The father is focused on establishing his career, while the mother cares for their young children. Despite their efforts, they rely on financial assistance and have minimal savings after covering rent and essentials. A washing machine (100cm height and below) would greatly improve their routine, allowing the mother to manage laundry more efficiently instead of hand-washing or using costly laundromats, which strain their limited budget and time.
