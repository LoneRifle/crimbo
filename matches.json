    "description": "Low income and single mother family of 2 (mother and teenage daughter) currently needs a new washing machine as its spoilt and they do not have money to get a new one or a second hand one as they are fully dependent on financial assistance as mother is unable to work due to her physical health issues and is on long term MC. She has limited mobility as well and requires a walking frame to walk. As the washing machine is spoilt, mother is unable to wash clothes properly (unable to bend her back to wash and daughter is usually only back home at night and unable to wash much). They hope to receive some support for a preloved but good working condition washing machine (with installation support) so that they can get back to their normal routines at home. Please feel free to reach out to me for more information if needed through email. Thank you for supporting the family!",
