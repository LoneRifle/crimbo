    "description": "Mr Zul lives with his spouse in a 2 room rental flat. Mr Zul has visual impairment and is wheelchair bound. \n\nThe wheelchair that Mr Zul purchased from carousell a few years ago had spoilt, putting him in a safety risk. \n\nA new wheelchair would help him to regain his mobility in a safe manner, so that his spouse would also be able to wheel him with confidence. \n\nIf there are any leads, feel free to contact me, Sabrina at 82922208. thank u!",
