As part of an arrangement with the school, she must accompany and fetch him daily, which limits her ability to work. Her husband, an Indian PR, has also recently lost his job, and the family is struggling to cope financially. Addressing these household repairs and furniture needs would greatly improve their living environment and the client’s overall well-being, particularly given her health sensitivities and caregiving responsibilities.",
