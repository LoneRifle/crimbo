The father is the sole breadwinner, while both the mother and daughter are coping with ongoing health issues that limit the family’s capacity to manage daily needs. The family’s current wardrobe has deteriorated to the point of rotting, attracting cockroaches and posing hygiene concerns. Their sofa was also disposed of months ago after becoming unusable, leaving them without proper seating at home. Given their financial constraints and health challenges, the family would greatly benefit from support to obtain a new wardrobe and sofa to ensure safe, dignified, and functional living conditions.\n\nDonor to kindly cover transport arrangement and delivery cost please. We can discuss further. Thanks!",
