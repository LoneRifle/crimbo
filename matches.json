Husband is still amid his National Service. The client is unable to work due the caregiving needs of her two young children.  The client has difficulties juggling the high supervision needs of her young children whilst managing the household chores. A playpen would really benefit in ensuring the children are placed in a safe space while the client is occupied in other household matters. However, as the family’s sole income is derived from husband’s National Service salary, it is insufficient for them to afford one and hence, are seeking the support from a kind donor for one.",
