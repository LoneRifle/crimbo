Patient's current baby cot had spoilt (one of the wheels had broke) and made it unsafe for patient to sleep in it. However, the couple could not afford to buy a new one. Hence, they would appreciate if they could get a baby cot (they are also open for preloved item) so that patient can sleep comfortably and safely. Thank you.",
