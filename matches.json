As family is currently facing tight finances and child protection concerns (father also difficulties securing a job due to his health), it has been difficult for the family to get some stable income. Mother is the main caregiver of the young children as they are not in childcare yet. The family would require some milk  support in the mean time as FSC work with them in exploring childcare placement and managing the child protection concerns. It would be helpful if a donor can provide 4-6 tins of 1.8kg Lactogen 3. Please feel free to email me for more information, thank you!",
