The family’s 43-inch TV was recently damaged, and they currently do not have a suitable screen for the child’s learning needs.\nThe TV plays an important role in the child’s early development, as it is used to show educational videos that can support his learning and cognitive growth. Compared to watching content on a phone, a TV allows the child to sit further away from the screen which would encourage better posture and reduce eye strain.\nThe mother has shared that a contribution of a TV would greatly help maintain a supportive and engaging learning environment for the child.",
