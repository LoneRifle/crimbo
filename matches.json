Our children's coffee cum study table has caved in due to wear and tear.\n\nFor safety reasons, we are looking to replace it with a sturdy table that does not come with any storage. We prefer a rectangular-shaped table so our boys can sit around it when studying. \n\nPlease donate only new or in good condition tables, as they are meant to last our residents for many years to come. Thank you!",
