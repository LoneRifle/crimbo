    "description": "Our client is the main breadwinner for his family of 10 living in a rental flat, which consists of the wife and the couple's 8 children (F1, M2, M3, M4, F6, M7, F11, and an infant who was born in Sept 2023 ). \nClient's Wife is unemployed due to her heavy caregiving duties for the 8 children. \nThe family have limited financial resources, where our client receives his salary as a security officer on an adhoc, and is sometimes unable to work as he has to support in the caregiving duties of the family, especially when the children fall sick.  The family's pre-loved dryer has recently spoilt, and they are requesting for a new dryer. \nThe family would greatly appreciate a dryer as it is an essential item in alleviating wife's time spent on doing the household chores, and providing her more bandwidth on ensuring her own mental health needs and the children's caregiving needs are met.",
