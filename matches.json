He was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2018 and underwent an operation to remove part of the colon that remove the cancerous cells. As such, he will need to be on diapers to manage his toileting. Client is working as a part-time porter at a hospital, having to manage the caregiving of her elderly parents (Aged 76 and 78). Because of client's low education background, she is stuck in lower waged work. As she is the main caregiver for her parents, she neeeds to engage in part-time employment in order to ensure parents are still being cared for. Her mother is also elderly in age and is weaker in her joints and limbs, unable to move around without assistance/walking frame. Client has applied for comcare assistance for financial support. While waiting for the approval, diapers for client's father will help to defray some household expenses while client continues to manage work alongside her caregiving duties.",
