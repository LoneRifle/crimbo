    "description": "A caregiver with mobility challenges and her two grandchildren live in a 1-room rental flat. Her 3 children are currently incarcerated and will be released this year. They do not have alternative housing arrangements and will be living in the flat. Due to space constraints, my caregiver hopes to receive a 3-seater sofa bed so that the family can live more comfortably temporarily until further housing arrangements can be made and processed. She hopes to receive either a new or pre-loved sofa bed, not of cloth material. Do reach out to Marilyn at 81214654 for further clarifications. Thank you!",
