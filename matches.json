She was just discharged from the halfway house a few months ago, realising that her washing machine is broken. She is working round the clock providing for her daughter and herself and is unable to handwash her clothes. Her daughter, who is a full-time student and on a nursing internship has little to no time to wash clothes as well. Without this essential appliance, she struggles to maintain proper hygiene whilst job searching and caring for her daughter. Any working washing machine would be greatly appreciated and would significantly help this family rebuild their lives.",
