Now she sleeps on the floor as father has no money to buy another mattress or sofabed for her and her back is aching as she has been sleeping like that for 2 weeks. It would be very helpful if a kind donor can donate a new mattress to the daughter to sleep on (they prefer new as now they are a bit sensitive about hygiene due to the flea issue).
