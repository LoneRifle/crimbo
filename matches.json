CT has been struggling to secure stable employment as he is also involved in caregiving responsibilities, particularly as his partner has been physically weak during this pregnancy. The family lacks informal support and relies on external organisations to meet their basic needs. Recently, their refrigerator and fan broke down, and they are unable to afford replacements. As such, the family requires assistance to obtain these essential household items.",

Due to the high caregiving demands, the client is currently unemployed and faces significant financial challenges. Recently, the family’s refrigerator broke down, making it difficult to store fresh groceries and prepare meals at home. As a result, the client has had to purchase food outside, which is not sustainable or economical given the family’s limited income. This situation has added to the caregiver’s stress and impacted the family’s ability to meet their basic nutritional needs. A replacement refrigerator would greatly support the family’s daily functioning and well-being. Given client's limited resources, seeking donor to cover delivery and installation fees (if any).",
