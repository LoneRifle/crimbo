Without a fridge, she struggles to store fresh food, which causes her to rely on processed foods, that may not fully meet her dietary needs. This affects her overall health and well-being, especially given her existing medical conditions. Similarly, not having a washing machine makes laundry physically demanding and relying on external laundry services can be costly and difficult to manage regularly, further straining her limited finances, and adding to her daily challenges. \n\nA donated washing machine and fridge would significantly improve her quality of life, allowing her to manage her household more independently and focus on her well-being. We would appreciate if you could source for a working washing machine or fridge that can be passed on to client to meet her needs.",
